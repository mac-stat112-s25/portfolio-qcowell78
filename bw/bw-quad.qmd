#| fig-cap: "This point plot shows average SAT scores from each state in the 1994-5 school year versus teacher salaries and average expenditure per pupil, divided by the percentage of students that take the SAT."
#| fig-alt: "A point plot showing average SAT scores by state in the 1994-5 school year versus average expenditure per pupil located on the x-axis, with point size indicating teacher salaries. This data is categorized based on the percentage of students taking the SAT by state, with lower percentages correlating with higher scores, and vice versa."
